This webpage is still a work in progress, and as such, certain elements have been left as default or placeholder. Projects will be updated later to have a corresponding image and project name will be replaced with an appropreate name.

Besides the GitHub link, none of the contact info is correct and will not take you anywhere as of this stage. These will also be updated in the future.
